      </p>
      <h4>
      Data license
      </h4>
      <p>
      As part of the Market Signal Service, Market Signal collects and generates certain Data by aggregating information regarding publicly available web pages, utilizing Market Signalâ€™s proprietary technology. This Data does not contain any personally identifiable information regarding any end users. As part of the API Service, certain Data is made publicly available to end-users.
      </p>
      <p>
      Data accessible through Market Signal may contain third party content (such as text, images, videos). This content will remain the sole responsibility of those who make it available. In some cases content accessible through our API may also be subject to intellectual property rights. If this is the case you may not use it unless you are licensed to do so or are otherwise permitted by law.

      Unless applicable by law or expressly permitted by the owner, you will not, and will not permit your end users or others acting on your behalf to, do any of the following with the Data returned from the API:

      Misrepresent the ownership or the source;
      Obscure, remove or change any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices;
      Falsify or delete any author attributions, legal notices, or other labels of the origin or source of material.
      Unless expressly authorized herein, you may not publicly release or disclose any data or usage statistics or other information regarding the Data.

      The materials appearing on Market Signal's website could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors.

      Attribution
      </h4>
      <p>
      Unless otherwise authorised, you shall agree to display an attribution to Market Signal alongside any implementation or display of the Market Signal Data to indicate that Market Signal technology is being used.

      </p>
      <h4>
      Developer plan
      </h4>
      <p>
      Market Signal provides a special Developer plan at no charge for new users of the Service. The Developer plan may be used for development and testing in a development environment only, and cannot be used in a staging or production environment (including internally).

      Access to the Developer plan will be granted for a maximum of one month. After one month passes, or if the Service has been integrated outside of a development environment (whichever happens sooner), license to use the Developer plan will be revoked and a paid subscription will be required to continue using the Service and Data.

      </p>
      <h4>
      Payment
      </h4>
      <p>
      By selecting a paid plan you agree to pay Market Signal the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service. Payments will be charged on a pre-pay basis on the day you sign up for a paid plan and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated. You represent and warrant that you are authorized, or have the permission of the authorized signatory of the credit card or charge card provided to Market Signal, to pay any fees incurred from use of the Service.

      Unless you notify Market Signal before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel a paid account, your paid subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. If you exhaust the allocation of API requests included in your plan you authorize us to collect the then-applicable fee (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you in exchange for another block of API requests. Paid plans can be canceled at any time in the Account section of the website.

      Unused API requests included in your plan do not roll over at the end of the month. Extra API requests purchased in blocks will rollover and have no expiration date.

      Refund and cancellation policy
      You may cancel your monthly or annual subscription at anytime. However Market Signal will not refund subscription fees for the current or previous period(s) unless previously agreed. Your access to Market Signal will remain enabled until the end of the current paid period.

      </p>
      <h4>
      Service level agreement
      </h4>
      <p>
      If we do not achieve and maintain the Service Levels for each plan as described in this SLA, then you may be eligible for a 25% credit towards your future monthly service fees.

      This SLA and any applicable Service Levels do not apply to any performance or availability issues:

      Due to factors outside our reasonable control (for example, natural disaster, war, acts of terrorism, riots, government action, or a network or device failure external to our data centers, including at your site or between your site and our data center);
      That result from the use of services, hardware, or software not provided by us, including, but not limited to, issues resulting from inadequate bandwidth or related to third-party software or services;
      Caused by your use of a Service after we advised you to modify your use of the Service, if you did not modify your use as advised;
      During or with respect to preview, pre-release, beta or trial versions of a Service, feature or software (as determined by us);
      That result from your unauthorized action or lack of action when required, or from your employees, agents, contractors, or vendors, or anyone gaining access to our network by means of your passwords or equipment, or otherwise resulting from your failure to follow appropriate security practices;
      That result from your failure to adhere to any required configurations, use supported platforms, follow any policies for acceptable use, or your use of the Service in a manner inconsistent with the features and functionality of the Service (for example, attempts to perform operations that are not supported) or inconsistent with our published guidance;
      That result from faulty input, instructions, or arguments (for example, requests to access data that does not exist);
      That result from your attempts to perform operations that exceed prescribed quotas or that resulted from our throttling of suspected abusive behavior;
      Monthly uptime calculation

      "Monthly Uptime Percentage" for each API Service is calculated as Total Request Attempts less Failed Requests divided by Total Request Attempts in a billing month for a given API subscription. Monthly Uptime Percentage is represented by the following formula:

      Monthly Uptime % = (Total Request Attempts - Failed Requests) / Total Request Attempts * 100

      </p>
      <h4>
      Customer data
      </h4>
      <p>
      Any personal information collected from Customer will be securely held and processed in accordance with local law and will never be shared with or sold to third parties.

      You agree to allow us to send you important notifications via email to the email address we have on record for you. You can opt out from these at any time.
