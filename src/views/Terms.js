            <p class="content">1.1. Overview of Services. {siteName} provides a financial data platform, together with related services and content. The Services may include access to various financial data feeds, as well as related applications. In addition to the terms set forth herein, each data feed or application may describe its own restrictions and limitations (e.g. redistribution restrictions and API usage limitations) during the selection process, and such terms are hereby incorporated into these Terms by reference to the extent you select or otherwise access or use the corresponding data feed or application.</p>
            <p class="content">1.2. Services Content. Excluding User Content (defined below), all content made available through the Services (including, without limitation, all information and infrastructure, associated financial tools, data, investment write-ups, user information, data, newsletters, blog posts, general text, graphics, and their selection and arrangement, collectively, the “Services Content”) is the proprietary information of {siteName}. No Services Content may be modified, copied, distributed, reproduced, republished, downloaded, posted, transmitted, or sold in any form or by any means, in whole or in part, without {siteName}’s prior written permission in each instance. Provided that you are eligible for use and access of the Services and subject to the conditions of these Terms of Service, you are granted a limited license to access the Services Content and to download or print a copy of any portion of the Services Content to which you have properly gained access solely for your own use, provided that you keep all copyright or other proprietary notices intact.

You agree to abide by all additional copyright notices or restrictions contained in the Services Content.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Data Feeds
            <p class="content">2.1. Overview. As noted above, {siteName} provides a financial data platform. Through such platform made available as part of the Services, you may order certain data feeds or applications. Each data feed and application may have its own specific terms applicable to such data feed or application (“Product Terms”), which are set forth in corresponding links presented with the data feed on the Site and also made available for review during the ordering process, and such Product Terms are hereby incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement by this reference and you automatically agree to such terms by ordering or otherwise accessing the corresponding data feed or application. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and Product Terms, the Product Terms shall control. One common data feed-specific term within the Product Terms specifies whether such data feed may be redistributed or not. Absent Product Terms to the contrary, the respective rights applicable to non-redistributable and redistributable data are set forth below in Sections 2.2, Sections 2.3 and 2.4, respectively. Another common data feed-specific term is the API Call Limits, which sets the maximum number of times an API call may be made at a certain time interval with respect to such data feed. A third common data feed-specific term within the Product Terms specifies whether such user of the data feed is a Professional or a Non-Professional. Absent Product Terms to the contrary, the respective rights applicable to Professionals and Non-Professionals set forth below in Sections 2.2 and 2.3, respectively.</p>
            <p class="content">The data feeds and applications may include data made available by {siteName} or third-party publishers distributing data through {siteName} and the {siteName} Data Applications available on the Site (collectively, “{siteName} Data”). Accordingly, certain data feeds or applications may require you to enter into an agreement directly with the third-party provider of such data feed or application. In such event, you may not access such data feed or application without agreeing to such terms, which shall constitute a direct agreement between you and the third party. You acknowledge and agree that {siteName} is not a party to such agreement, and you hereby hold {siteName} harmless from all liability arising out of or relating to such agreement. “{siteName} Data Applications” means the {siteName} API, {siteName} Excel Add-In, and {siteName} Screener for Excel, and other web or software services or applications developed by {siteName} and made available to you that utilize or interact with the {siteName} Data, as well as any related documentation, source code, applications and other materials related thereto.</p>
            <p class="content">2.2. Non-Redistribution, Professional Use Parameters. With respect to all {siteName} Data identified as being provided with no redistribution rights, you may not redistribute such {siteName} Data. Your use of such {siteName} Data is exclusively for professional research purposes and may not be utilized to build an application intended for use by end users other than for you. You may not share your access to the {siteName} Data with other individuals. You must disclose in any printed or shared document containing the {siteName} Data either the {siteName} logo or reference that the data is from {siteName}. For example, you may use the data to create reports (e.g. analyst reports), provided that the data is presented in a static manner and repackaged in a form that adds additional information or analysis of the data beyond basic sharing of the data itself in isolation. You may not, however, include {siteName} Data identified as being provided with no redistribution rights in any application or otherwise provide or display the data to a third-party in a dynamic manner (i.e. frequently updating the data being displayed (through technological means relating to an API call or otherwise) as opposed to presenting the data within a certain set once as it exists at a specific moment in time). In the event the Product Terms include additional or conflicting terms with respect to the non-redistribution use parameters, such Product Terms shall apply and supersede these Terms where they conflict.</p>
            <p class="content">2.3. Non-Redistribution, Non-Professional Use Parameters. With respect to all {siteName} Data identified as being provided with no redistribution rights, you may not redistribute such {siteName} Data. Your use of such {siteName} Data is exclusively for personal or research purposes and may not be utilized to build an application intended for use by end users other than for you. You may not utilize the {siteName} Data for professional purposes for which you are compensated. You may not share your access to the {siteName} Data with other individuals. You must disclose in any printed or shared document containing the {siteName} Data either the {siteName} logo or reference that the data is from {siteName}. For example, you may use the data to create reports (e.g. analyst reports), provided that the data is presented in a static manner and repackaged in a form that adds additional information or analysis of the data beyond basic sharing of the data itself in isolation. You may not, however, include {siteName} Data identified as being provided with no redistribution rights in any application or otherwise provide or display the data to a third-party in a dynamic manner (i.e. frequently updating the data being displayed (through technological means relating to an API call or otherwise) as opposed to presenting the data within a certain set once as it exists at a specific moment in time). In the event the Product Terms include additional or conflicting terms with respect to the non-redistribution use parameters, such Product Terms shall apply and supersede these Terms where they conflict.</p>
            <p class="content">2.4. Redistribution Use Parameters. With respect to all {siteName} Data identified as being provided with redistribution rights, you are permitted to receive, process, and display the {siteName} Data in your own application to individual end users of your application, provided you or your End Users use the data in such a way as to not resell or otherwise commercially exploit the {siteName} Data (provided that you may commercialize your application so long as such commercialization and the demand for such application is not directly or primarily tied to the {siteName} Data itself and material, substantial functionality and/or analysis is provided in connection with such {siteName} Data). You are also permitted to systematically query the API with respect to such data (subject to applicable Daily API Call Limits). You must disclose in your application, website or software (on any page where {siteName} Data is used) either the {siteName} logo or reference that the data is from {siteName}. In the event the Product Terms include additional or conflicting terms with respect to the redistribution use parameters, such Product Terms shall apply and supersede these Terms where they conflict.</p>
            <p class="content">2.5. Restrictions. Regardless of whether the data is redistributable, you shall not repackage or resell the {siteName} Data or {siteName} Data Applications in any form, including, without limitation, bulk form (subject to your limited rights to use and display the data as set forth in Section 2.2, Section 2.3, or Section 2.4 as applicable, and provided further that an entire data feed may be used within a report provided it is repackaged and accompanied by additional analysis as opposed to general republishing). If you reach your Daily API Call Limit for your subscription (which is set forth in the applicable Product Terms), your service will be shut off until the next day, which resets at 12:00am Eastern Standard Time US. Additionally, as noted above, your access and use of each {siteName} data feed or application is subject to any restrictions and limitations (e.g. redistribution restrictions and API usage limitations) set forth in the Product Terms for each such data feed or application.</p>
